## Phase 0 — Scaffold and tooling (2026-10-13)

**Built**
- uv project pinned to Python 3.12.15 (system Python is 3.14; `.python-version` pins 3.12).
- Full dependency set installed: polars, duckdb, pandera[polars], pydantic, pyyaml,
  scikit-learn, pyfixest, linearmodels, statsmodels, typer, jinja2, numpy, pyarrow;
  dev: ruff, mypy, pytest, pytest-cov, hypothesis, pre-commit.
- Repo structure from spec section 4 (all `src/margin_engine/` submodules, `synth/`,
  `tests/fixtures`, `tests/property`, `config/mappings`, `data/sample`, `docs/`).
- `src/margin_engine/config.py`: pydantic models for all 13 `rules.yaml` sections
  (schema, mapping, units_and_currency, transactions, costing, waterfall, outliers,
  segmentation, price_guidance, sensitivity, opportunity, tariff_scenarios, reporting),
  frozen + `extra="forbid"` so unknown keys fail at load. Defaults encode section 8
  (z 3.5, peer-group min 30, tree depths 5/4, leaf minimums 500/0.5%/20 customers/10 items,
  5% pocket-margin floor as Decimal, F ≥ 10, lookback 6 months, baseline 12 months,
  pass-through 0/50/100%).
- `config/rules.yaml` default policy file, including both instruments with documented
  exclusion rationales (required later for `causal_elasticity_supported`).
- Typer CLI with `version` and `validate-config`; `run` arrives in Phase 8.
- GitHub Actions CI (lint, format check, mypy, pytest+cov), pre-commit config, .gitignore.

**Verification**
- `uv sync`: pass. `ruff check` + `ruff format`: pass. `mypy src` (strict on
  `margin_engine.*`): pass, 0 issues. `pytest`: 9/9 pass (config schema tests:
  defaults match spec, unknown keys rejected, invalid values rejected, Decimal type
  enforced for margin floor). CI and pre-commit YAML parse cleanly.

**Decisions**
- Windows Application Control blocks the `pytest.exe` shim in `.venv/Scripts`; all
  local test runs use `uv run python -m pytest` (identical behavior). CI on Ubuntu
  is unaffected.
- mypy strict scoping done via `[[tool.mypy.overrides]] module = "margin_engine.*"
  strict = true` rather than global strict, so tests/synth get normal checking.
- `min_pocket_margin` parses from a YAML string ("0.05") into Decimal to keep the
  money-is-exact rule even in config.

**Known gaps**
- mypy notes unused `ignore_missing_imports` override sections for libraries not yet
  imported (pandera, sklearn, pyfixest, linearmodels, statsmodels, scipy, duckdb) —
  they activate as later phases import them.
